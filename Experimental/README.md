# PumpProbeAutomation
Code to make taking data and image with two triggered lasers a lot quicker

Interfaces photodiode oscilliscope measurement, DG645 Delay Generator to trigger pump and probe laser, and saves images from Teledyne PI-MAX camera.
Measures and saves the time between photodiode probe and pump laser. Also saves a before, during, and after image. Easy user control through the terminal.

Relies on chowdhurylabdevices Repo to interface.
